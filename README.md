Sorry for bad code & haos in files. It was my first "big" project, At that time i didn't know about SOLID, I knew only basic rules of OOP, and my code style was like a shit (At that time I knew c# only 2 months)

So, what this program can do:

1. There are license , I have key generator, if you will need a full version of program write to me (Ihorkayf_@mail.ru). Or you can see source code of checking license key and generate key manualy.

2. You can choose a size of your maze (N * M) and click "Genere Maze" button. And you will see you maze on PictureBox. Generating of Maze is based on Eller Algorithm (if you are intersted in this, find information in google).

3. In full version of program , you can choose an entry point and exit point, after clicking on "Solve Maze", you will see how program solve this maze (find way from entry point - to exit point). 

4. My task was only to Generate Maze, but I did overwork and added function for solving maze. So, there are some bugs....
